                                        text area below, if you want to read the entire article in your web browser you have to
                                        doubleclick the news in the news list or press the &quot;Open in browser&quot; button.<br>

				    <li>By pressing SHIFT and double-clicking an item in the newspaper list will open a dialog which displays: the newspaper name, its path on disk, the feed address, and the number of contained articles (files).</li>
				    <li>File->Settings will open a cryptic dialog that handles some settings stored on a config file, in the "General" tab you'll see two options listed: "sort" and "minimized". While "sort" value is easily changed selecting the sorting method in "Sort By" menu, "minimized" is a hidden configuration in order for FeedGator to be launched minimized.</br>The timer tab is more interesting because it allows you to configure a personalized update-interval for FeedGator to retrieve the news. With the "enable" item you can set or disable it, and with the "timer" item you can set the update interval value in microseconds, the default timer is set to 5 minutes.</li>
